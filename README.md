# SML
# 1. Abstraction
  The purpose of this project is suggesting ROS based TX2 prototype for Autonomous Driving based on VDCL algorithm.
  
  Current version of TX2 prototype has been verified from real-road test. 
  
  All of ROS device drivers can be easily implemented following directions in each sensors' folder.
